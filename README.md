# Google Tech Dev Guide

My work on the **Google Tech Dev Guide**. 
(I have included task lists to check my progress)

**Follow** me on my journey, the road is still long :grin:

**Note**: in the [**External Resources**](#external-resources) section, I will add **free** and **always-available** public sources, such as *YouTube videos*, *tutorials*, *etc* ... that I will use along my path.
